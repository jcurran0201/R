# R Homework
## Deliverable 1
### 	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? 
#### Vehicle length, ground clearance, AWD
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
#### No bc the coefficients are not zero and the P value is very small.
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 
#### Somewhat because r^2 value of 0.68 is closer to 1 than 0. 
## Deliverable 2  
#### 	The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
### Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?  
#### Yes because the variance is less than 1.  
## Summary is in the bottom left

## Deliverable 3 
### briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary. 
#### 	Total sample Not statistically different because it is over 0.05 
#### Lot 1 Not statistically different because it is over 0.05 
#### Lot 2 not statistically different because it is over 0.05 
#### Lot 3 is statistically different because it is under 0.05
